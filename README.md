# Releaseros - Release Note Generator

WIP

TODOs: 
- [X] config
- [X] chose behavior for first release: either list all or just display a custom text
- [X] real errors
- [X] logs
- [X] clean code and tests
- [X] more tests
- [X] add `Full Changelog: v0.3.0...v0.4.0` at the end of the release note => use footer to do that and let the user do that itself
- [ ] logo of Gene the Releaseros
- [X] add init config command to generate suggested config
- [ ] ??? move from urfave/cli to another? too many issues with it
- [ ] write documentation
- [ ] provide docker image
    - [ ] choose a container registry first. Where do we want to host this project?
        - Github
            - more visibility
            - easier to provide multiple target support
            - less decentralized :/
        - Gitlab?
        - Why not using gitlab with a mirroring on github? Or the other way?
- [ ] if using github then move ci
- [ ] configure goreleaser
